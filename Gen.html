    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p><span class="number">1 </span>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 
    <p><span class="number">2 </span>Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.</p>
    <p><span class="number">3 </span>And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 
    <p><span class="number">4 </span>God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. <span class="number">5 </span>God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.<br>
    <p><span class="number">6  </span>And God said, “Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.” <br>
    <p><span class="number">7  </span>So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so..<br>
    <p><span class="number">8  </span>God called the vault “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.<br>
    <p><span class="number">9  </span>And God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.” And it was so. <br>
    <p><span class="number">10  </span>God called the dry ground “land,” and the gathered waters he called “seas.” And God saw that it was good.<br><br>

      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <p>Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array. By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work. And God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.</p>

      <p>Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden’?”</p>
